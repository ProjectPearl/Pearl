# Project Video

## Status

**Video coming soon!** We're recording a 30-60 second raw video showing:
- Robot failing (real failure, not staged)
- Submitting data via web form
- Viewing experiment log

## Why This Matters

Raw, unpolished video converts skeptics instantly. It shows:
- This is real hardware
- This is real data
- This is real work

## Where to Upload

Once recorded, upload to:
- **GitHub**: Add to `docs/video/` directory (if < 100MB)
- **YouTube**: Upload as unlisted, link in README
- **GitHub Releases**: Attach as release asset

## Video Checklist

- [ ] Show robot attempting task
- [ ] Show failure (real, not staged)
- [ ] Show data submission form
- [ ] Show experiment appearing in browser
- [ ] Keep it raw — no editing, no polish
- [ ] 30-60 seconds total
- [ ] Include timestamp/date

## Link Format

Once uploaded, add to README like:

```markdown
## See It In Action

*This video is more valuable than polished demos. Real failures build trust.*

# Insights

This directory contains data-driven insights from collected experiments.

## Current Insights

- [001: Ultrasonic Sensor False Positives](001_ultrasonic_false_positives.md) - Most navigation failures caused by false positive obstacle detection

## How to Contribute Insights

1. Analyze experiment data in `experiments/`
2. Look for patterns, correlations, or surprising findings
3. Create a markdown file following the format of existing insights
4. Include:
   - Clear finding/claim
   - Evidence from data
   - Visualization (chart, table, or simple ASCII)
   - Implications
   - Recommendations

## What Makes a Good Insight

- **Data-driven**: Based on actual experiment data
- **Actionable**: Leads to concrete recommendations
- **Surprising**: Not obvious without analysis
- **Replicable**: Others can verify with same data

## Not ML (Yet)

These insights are about understanding hardware, sensors, and real-world behavior. We're not training models yet — we're building understanding first.

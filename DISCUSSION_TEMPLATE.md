## Title

**What experiment should we add next?**

## Body

We have two experiments so far:
- Balance bot (0001) - balancing on two wheels
- Navigation bot (0002) - obstacle avoidance

**What should we tackle next?**

Some ideas:
- Manipulation task (grasping, pushing)
- Multi-robot coordination
- Different sensor types (camera, LiDAR)
- Different platforms (quadruped, flying)
- Different tasks (sorting, assembly)

**What interests you? What hardware do you have? What would teach us something new?**

This is your space to think with us. No idea is too small. No hardware is too simple.

## Why This Matters

This gives people permission to think with you. It's not about getting the "right" answer — it's about starting a conversation.

People contribute to projects they feel part of. Discussions make them feel part of the project.
